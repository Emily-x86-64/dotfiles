Gay pride or LGBT pride is the promotion of the self-affirmation, dignity, equality, and increased 
visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people as a social group. Pride, as opposed to
shame and social stigma, is the predominant outlook that bolsters most LGBT rights movements. Pride
has lent its name to LGBT-themed organizations, institutes, foundations, book titles, periodicals, a cable TV station, and the Pride Library.
